Linus Torwalds, the creator of both Linux and Git, explained in a 2014 interview, "In general, the best way to learn git is probably to start by doing only very basic things without paying attention to advanced features until you are familiar and confident with the basics." This is exactly the approach this book takes, we see the step-by-step path that developers use to work with the essential tool that is git.
Starting from the basics (installation, initialization), we will build together a git repository and see step-by-step:
- how to add changes to the index and save them in a commit,
- what the git tree is,
- how to manage branches to work in isolation then recombine the work,
- how to manage the stash,
- how to work with remote repositories, especially on GitHub
